### Bash Script

Run the script provided in this repo to join the provider chain:
* `join-release-testnet.sh` will create a `exocored` service.
* Script must be run either as root or from a sudoer account.
* Script will attempt to download the amd64 binary from the Exocore [releases](https://github.com/ExocoreNetwork/exocore/releases) page. You can modify the `CHAIN_BINARY_URL` to match your target architecture if needed.

#### State Sync Option

* By default, the script will sync from genesis block, to turn on state sync to catch up quickly to the current height, set `STATE_SYNC` to `true`.
